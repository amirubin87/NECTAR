# NECTAR
Node-centric ovErlapping Community deTection AlgoRithm

This repository contains implementations of the NECTAR algorithm as described in: Node-centric detection of overlapping communities in social networks (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.01683)
As well as tools we used such as Omega-Index.

Under 'V2/NECTAR_Beta' you will find the latest version. Note - it does not support threads. In the future we will add more metrics (probably conductance is next).
Under 'V2/NECTAR' you will find the version which supports threads. We will not continue to devolop this one.
Under 'V1' you can find two java implemented version to the NECTAR algorithm (one with modularity, one with WOCC).
('V2' is the version similar to 'V1', except that the objective function is chosen by the algorithm.)
Under 'Tools' u can find our implementation to the Omega-Index and Average F1 score calculating tool. 
Under 'ML' u can find the training set used to train the Random Forst used by NECTAR.
