# NECTAR
Node-centric ovErlapping Community deTection AlgoRithm

This repository contains implementations of the NECTAR algorithm as described in: TODO.
As well as tools we used such as Omega-Index.

Under 'V1' u can find two java implemented version to the NECTAR algorithm.
Under 'Tools' u can find our implementation to the Omega-Index and Average F1 score calculating tool. 
Under 'ML' u can find the training set used to train the Random Forst used by NECTAR.
'V2' is the version similar to 'V1', except that the objective function is chosen by the algorithm.
